4. Install Playwright (e.g. installation doc https://playwright.dev/docs/intro )

4.1 (select JavaScript while installing - make a choice via up/down keys)

5. Add to package.json file a command for test running via console:
npm run test-all

6. Update playwright.config.js file according to lesson example (comment extra commands, select and set what is required for described test).

7. Add tests from the lesson according to the learned architecture approach (src> pages, steps, tests with basePage and baseSteps, loginPage and loginStep, login test etc. There is no needs to add hooks and etc like in Selenium projects).
